# Ralph

Ralph is a Lisp-1 dialect that compiles to JavaScript. It is inspired by
[Dylan - An object-oriented dynamic language](http://lispm.de/docs/prefix-dylan/book.annotated/contents.html).

## Getting started

Install [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and [ws](https://github.com/einaros/ws), then:

* `$ NODE_PATH=core node repl.js`

## Development

Recompile the compiler and run all tests using:

* `$ ./scripts/test-self.sh`
